<title> Collaborative design studio 2 </title>
<synopsis> This unit further develops the students' design skills within a collaborative environment. Students will engage in projects of growing complexity that have multiple approaches and potential outcomes. The students build upon their prior experience of the design process to discover, define, create and demonstrate their design ability in a interdisciplinary way. They will develop designs to a stage that allows reflective critical analysis. Students will be expected to demonstrate a strong capability to resolve and defend their designs. Students will be encouraged to engage with topics that drawn from the research agenda of the Faculty and Department of Design. This enables the integration of staff research with the educational aspirations of the unit. Students are therefore exposed to an advanced knowledge in particular areas, and areas in which to engage their own growing skill sets. </synopsis>

<synopsis> In the contemporary world the political and economic leaders of capitalist and socialist societies have come to accept that effective governance requires both markets and regulation. But while this consensus exists there is substantial disagreement as regards what constitutes the optimal mix of markets and regulation. In this subject we introduce students to both the system of regulatory capitalism that prevails in the OECD and to the regulatory socialist form of governance that is being created in China. In so doing we explain why the concurrent existence of these two systems of governance have become a source of global tension. </synopsis>

<title> Global disasters: Catastrophe and social change </title>
<synopsis> This unit examines the social history and impact of disasters from the late nineteenth century to recent times. Case studies include environmental and industrial disasters, pandemics, famines, and climate change events. We examine the processes that make disasters 'global', like travel and communications technologies and environmental systems. Using films, photographs, media reports and autobiographical sources, we examine the representation and experience of disasters to learn how they have been understood, experienced and responded to in contested ways. In doing so, we analyse the social causes of 'natural' and 'unnatural' disasters; how catastrophes have been catalysts for social change; and how disasters stimulate utopian and dystopian ideas about the globe's future. </synopsis>

From key moments in early cinema, such as the production of the world's first feature film The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), through the broadcast of international sporting events like the Melbourne Olympic Games (1956), and on to a signal institution for screen exhibition and curation such as the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, there is barely an aspect of Melbourne that is not illuminated by its screen cultures. This unit examines all aspects of Melbourne screen cultures and the institutions that support them, as well as screen-related experiences of the city, tourism, identity and place. In doing so, the unit explores contemporary and historical fiction, documentary and experimental screen forms and representations, alongside the functions and uses of mobile screens, large format screens, and various digital production, exhibition, and distribution screen technologies and institutions. Screen memories and experiences will be captured in both research-based and practice-led approaches. </synopsis>

<title> The individual and society </title>
<synopsis> The unit examines both the place of the individual in society, and the social structures that shape the opportunities and inequalities experienced by individuals. We do this through three rotating modules of study that may include: race, digital social media, popular culture, health, the environment and sustainability, families, and youth. While the topics may vary, at the core of the unit is a focus on structure (the persistent arrangements of our society) and agency (the power of an individual to act within society). We will also closely examine social inequalities within the specific modules of study, with the key question being: who benefits from the existing social order? This unit complements and builds on the introduction to sociology unit (<span class="unitlink"><a href="/pubs/2019handbooks/units/ATS1365.html">ATS1365) but is also independent, and does not require previous study in sociology. </synopsis>

<title> The individual and society </title>
<synopsis> The unit examines both the place of the individual in society, and the social structures that shape the opportunities and inequalities experienced by individuals. We do this through three rotating modules of study that may include: race, digital social media, popular culture, health, the environment and sustainability, families, and youth. While the topics may vary, at the core of the unit is a focus on structure (the persistent arrangements of our society) and agency (the power of an individual to act within society). We will also closely examine social inequalities within the specific modules of study, with the key question being: who benefits from the existing social order? This unit complements and builds on the introduction to sociology unit (<span class="unitlink"><a href="/pubs/2019handbooks/units/ATS1365.html">ATS1365) but is also independent, and does not require previous study in sociology. </synopsis>

This will be followed by a Health Enhancement program concentrating on self care (stress management, relaxation training, coping skills), other aspects of healthy lifestyle and group support, and introduction to the science of Mind-Body Medicine. Also included: an introduction to Ethics and Medical Law.THEME II: Population, Society, Health and Illness: Health, Knowledge and Society Teaching will provide a framework of inquiry allowing analysis of the social aspects of medicine.THEME III: Foundations of Medicine: The Fabric of Life provides students with foundation knowledge in genomics and cell biology in health and disease. An integral part of this theme will be the weekly problem based  learning activity(PBL). Each PBL integrates material presented to students in this and other themes throughout the week.THEME IV: Clinical Skills: introduces students to practical clinical skills including: handwashing, sharps disposal; subcutaneous and intramuscular injecting. Students will interact with health care professionals during medical contact visits, and will be introduced to the medical interview, taking a family history, ethical aspects of medical contact visits. </synopsis>

<title> Working with families across the lifespan </title>
<synopsis> This unit introduces the concept of working with families from a strengths-based framework. The concept of family strengths has been studied for several decades and describes a family that functions optimally in support of the individual members. When nurses and other professionals use a family strengths theoretical framework in their daily practice, they contribute to providing health care that focuses on the whole rather than only the individual and begin to support families when accessing health care. A healthy family may be stronger in one area than another, and strengths may overlap with each other. It is well known that the family environment may have a positive or a negative effect on individuals in the family, depending on the family's values, beliefs, and ability to manage change. The composition and structure of contemporary families are wide-ranging, and include families from varying cultures, with composition including single and extended families, and families at differing socioeconomic levels. This unit aims to bridge the gap in theoretical content related to family care across the lifespan so that nurses and other professionals can explore the factors that shape their capacity to develop caring relationships with individuals, families, groups, populations, and communities. </synopsis>

<title> Cultural diversity in contemporary Europe </title>
<synopsis> The unit, presented over a four week period, involves a research-led case study of cultural diversity in Europe. Based at Monash University's Prato Centre, students will be introduced to the main overarching theories concerning migration and cultural diversity. Within these overarching theories, students will also encounter numerous concepts and perspectives including among others, cosmopolitanism, assimilation, integration, multiculturalism, insider-outsider relations and the notion of 'othering'. Issues relating to race, culture, identity and citizenship will also be considered. The uniqueness of the unit and its relevance to the Prato setting is that students will use these theoretical underpinnings to frame a case study involving observational research to complete 3000 word case study concerning managing cultural diversity in Europe. Students will be encouraged to observe cultural similarities and differences, and particularly the interactions between different cultural groups. The unit aims to provide understandings of managing cultural diversity and a unique experience in undertaking observational research in a European setting. While the topic is a core focus and one of the research strengths in Sociology, it will appeal to students in a range of disciplines including those interested in international relations, law, criminology and Bachelor of Arts students in general. </synopsis>

<title> Russia and the US: Comparative politics </title>
<synopsis> The subject examines the domestic politics of Russia and United States. Both countries are two of the most powerful and influential countries within the Asia-Pacific region and globally. Developing knowledge of Russian and American politics and societies, students will enhance their understanding of the dynamics of governing ethnically and religiously diverse societies with many competing-and at times sharply antagonistic-interests, and countries with substantial military and economic prowess. The unit closely analyses both countries' political cultures, electoral politics, political institutions and contemporary social issues (i.e., debates over gender and minority rights), and struggles with extremism and terrorism. Notably, the subject addresses the extent to which Russia's conception of 'Sovereign Democracy' and the US' 'American Exceptionalism' influence how Russian and American citizens (and politicians) view themselves and their countries' status in the world, and if this makes them unique as powerful states, or whether their political behaviour and sense of national identity and destiny are common amongst modern nation-states. Upon completing the subject, students should have also developed a nuanced grasp of the broader field of comparative politics, and its main conceptual approaches and interpretive frameworks-to complement their knowledge of Russian and US politics. </synopsis>

<title> Animal behaviour </title>
<synopsis> This unit deals with several key areas of animal behaviour. We investigate animal communication systems, with particular emphasis on how signals are produced, transmitted and received, their information content and how they are sometimes used in social manipulation. We then go on to explore the way in which behaviour develops during the animal's early life and the various influences that shape this development before moving on to examine the genetic regulation of behaviour, how behaviour evolves and how we can use comparative methods to study this process. The rest of the unit is then devoted to behavioural ecology which deals with the role of behaviour in the animal's interactions with its environment and the ways in which the environment shapes adaptive behaviour on an evolutionary time scale. Topics covered in this area include foraging and anti-predator behaviour, social organisation, mating systems and parental care. </synopsis>

<synopsis> Topic 1: Design thinkingThe success of practising managers in designing and delivering project to outcomes is a critical factor in their career success. Design thinking applies the skills and strategies developed by designers to a wide range of problems and situations. These include a range of conceptual and communication approaches, ways to explore and reconsider the context in whch work is undertaken, as well as what should or could be achieved. Design thinking brings together several approaches known in the sciences and humanities, such as analysis and synthesis, but applies them in ways that are particular to a design approach. Design thinking can enable a more flexible approach to problem solving, and a more nuanced engagement with the complex issues of our contemporary world. Formal project management models and competencies will also be explored. The pedagogy will include a range of cases and applications.Topic 2: Commercialisation of technologyThe rapid rate of technological change in a knowledge-based society highlights the need for advanced technological capability, innovative thinking and practice and entrepreneurial capability. For management students, a sound understanding of the application of science and engineering technologies to social and economic problems, and the knowledge and capability to contribute to the commercialisation of technological innovations is necessary to function in sophisticated, technology-led business environments. The unit draws on the expertise and experience of colleagues in a range of university faculties to provide an overview of technology development and commercialisation in fields such as life sciences, medical devices, information systems, energy, materials science and nanotechnology.Topic 3: Business financeBusiness finance introduces the resourcing theories and practices that contribute to the sustainable, strategic management of organisations. The unit takes a value-impacting approach to interrated issues of investment, financing, budgeting and operations. Drawing on cross-disciplinary perspectives, Business finance develops frameworks for analysis and decision-making of relevance to executives and managers in contemporary organisations including start-up venture-financing. The unit examines how financial and economic information is used to gain forward intelligence on the ability of the organisation to create sustainable value. An experiential, practice-based pedagogy is adopted. </synopsis>

<title> Environmental activism, ecoterrorism and the law </title>
<synopsis> This subject is designed to provide both a comprehensive and critical introduction to global ecoterrorism.  The subject introduces students to the broad political challenges raised by the global environmental crisis both in the developed and developing world. The general historical evolution of international environmental law and policy will also be analysed.  Attention will be given to the major environmental, economic and political tensions that have both shaped and constrained the evolution of 'ecoterrorist' groups.The subject will in particular focus on the key individuals and major 'ecoterrorist' groups that have grown up as disillusion with the pace of environmental change within global society has increased. The subject will critically analyse the key groups often categorised as ecoterrorist including Earth First!, the Earth Liberation Front, the Animal Liberation Front and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.  It will focus on their founders, historical development, key philosophical beliefs and practices.  Students will be encouraged to draw on theoretical debates to identify the ways in which modern ecoterrorism has tested and/or reinforced the traditional assumptions, ideologies, arguments and institutions of international environmental law and policy.Students will be challenged to develop and refine their ability to analyse critically the different ways in which environmental problems and risks are perceived, framed and managed by differently situated actors within an ecoterrorist context.  The subject  cover the international and domestic legal responses to ecoterrorism. The subject also contextualises the major legal developments by examining the key state and nonstate actors and institutions involved in the negotiation, settlement and enforcement of law relating to ecoterrorist activities.  Finally, the evolving nature of international ecoterrorism law and policy, including problems and prospects for the future, will be critically examined. </synopsis>

<synopsis> The aim of this unit is to understand and develop the students understanding and practical skill regarding the relationship between production and manufacture. The studio takes the student through a number of key studio based explorations that underpin and develop an understanding of the inter-relationship between a desired physical outcome and the manner of its production. This includes an appreciation of the core principles of manufacture methods and the impact upon the design of an object due to materiality. Students are encouraged to apply theoretical learning with an experimental approach to problem solving. Project work is presented in folio format, documented for production. Final design proposals are also undertaken in detailed model or prototypical form where appropriate. </synopsis>

<title> Grand theories of politics and international relations </title>
<synopsis> This unit investigates the concept of 'the political' in modern and contemporary political theory. In the late twentieth century key Western European and American thinkers and government advisors claimed that humanity had arrived at the end of history. The combination of the 'liberal' state and capitalism, they claimed, embodies the ultimate form of human organisation. Politics, they argued, is therefore a thing of the past. Many contemporary political theorists challenge this 'post-political' consensus. In doing so they draw on grand theories of politics to develop a range of concepts of 'the political'. This unit aims to examine these different discourses and concepts of 'the political' and to assess their significance for contemporary political questions regarding justice, citizenship and recognition in a globalised, post-Westphalian world. It focuses on the political theories of Carl Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, Jurgen Habermas, Axel Honneth, Chantal Mouffe, Nancy Fraser and Martha Nussbaum. </synopsis>

<title> Illustration for narrative </title>
<synopsis> Illustration for Narrative explores the role of illustration and related image-making within a contemporary visual communication landscape. It intends to address the diverse media through which image-making can communicate ideas and narrate scenarios through both still and moving image. Contemporary image-makers need to know how to harness the potential of story-telling through various mediaexposure to, and experience with, the diverse processes available in essential to this end. Particular emphasis will be placed on the visual interpretation of words and stories, extracting the essence of their narrative content through visual means. These 'stories' may be provided or authored by the students themselves. </synopsis>

<title> Artefacts, objects and remains: Making sense of archaeological sites </title>
<synopsis> Archaeologists understand archaeological sites by the artefacts they contain. The unit examines how archaeologists analyse collections of different kinds of artefacts excavated or collected from archaeological sites, and how histories of the past can be written from these finds. Such objects can include the spectacular, such as status objects and religious icons; and more mundane objects such as ancient food remains, stone artefacts and domestic pottery such as cooking wares. Students will work with real archaeological artefact assemblages and be shown how these can be made sense of as evidence of past cultural practices. They will compare archaeological artefacts with reference materials and systematically apply established methods of analysis developed internationally. These methods, and their implications for understanding the past, will be discussed through case studies drawn from current archaeological projects in the Australia-Pacific region. Students will be expected to attend a weekly 2 hour seminar that includes hands-on discussions of archaeological materials. A film of an archaeological excavation will be shown in one of those seminars, after which students will discuss how artefacts have enabled the archaeologists to work out that site's history. </synopsis>

<title> Transport and traffic engineering </title>
<synopsis> This unit introduces students to the field of transport and traffic engineering. The fundamental parameters used to describe deterministic traffic flow behaviour are introduced along with a simple traffic flow model. Stochastic traffic flow behaviour is described via random distributions. Fundamental queuing theory of traffic is briefly introduced. The procedures used to analyse the capacity and level of service are explored for both unsignalised and signalised intersections. The principle of traffic signal operation at isolated intersections is presented. Traffic surveys are discussed and students are introduced to contemporary road safety issues as well. Public transport is considered at the route level concerning the determination of fleet size and factors affecting operational capacity and reliability. Non-motorised transport including cyclists and pedestrians is also considered. In addition, the unit addresses Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Consideration will also be given to the role of communications in the practice of transport and traffic engineers. To enhance students' understanding of the unit content from practical points of view, some experts will be invited to give lectures on their relevant work. Throughout the whole unit, the focus is primarily on surface transport systems and applications of advanced technologies therein. </synopsis>

<title> Ethics and the modern world </title>
<synopsis> The unit adopts a global perspective but looks at issues through a South African and African lens. The theories of utilitarianism and deontology will be examined within the South African context and judged according to ethical dilemmas that arise within the country. Key to this examination will be a discussion of the role of friendship and family within ethical decision-making. A major focus of discussion is the opposition between consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, which judge rightness and wrongness solely in terms of consequences, and the Kantian theory of deontology which judges rightness and wrongness according to whether the act is in accordance with rational will. The question that will guide this discussion is whether these theories can account for the agent-centred reasons which arise from relations of love and friendship and which seem to have the potential to conflict with impartial moral requirements? </synopsis>

<title> Data analytics </title>
<synopsis> In recent years the world has seen an explosion in the quantity and variety of data routinely recorded and analyzed by research and industry, prompting some social commentators to refer to this phenomenon as the rise of "big data," and the analysts and practitioners who investigate the data as "data scientists."The data may come from a variety of sources, including scientific experiments and measurements, or may be recorded from human interactions such as browsing data or social networks on the Internet, mobile phone usage or financial transactions. Many companies too, are realising the value of their data for analysing customer behavior and preferences, recognising patterns of behaviour such as credit card usage or insurance claims to detect fraud, as well as more accurately evaluating risk and increasing profit.In order to obtain insights from big data new analytical techniques are required by practitioners. These include computationally intensive and interactive approaches such as visualisation, clustering and data mining. The management and processing of large data sets requires the development of enhanced computational resources and new algorithms to work across distributed computers.This unit will introduce students to the analysis and management of big data using current techniques and open source and proprietary software tools. Data and case studies will be drawn from diverse sources including health and informatics, life sciences, web traffic and social networking, business data including transactions, customer traffic, scientific research and experimental data. The general principles of analysis, investigation and reporting will be covered. Students will be encouraged to critically reflect on the data analysis process within their own domain of interest. </synopsis>

<title> General linguistics </title>
<synopsis> Language is infinitely creative, yet governed by a set of rules that speakers learn consciously and subconsciously. This unit focuses on making our implicit knowledge about language more explicit. It does this through the two-pronged approach of introducing terminology and notation systems for talking about language structures, and applying this knowledge to real-world language problems. Through a focus on phonetics and phonology (the sounds of speech) and morpho-syntax ('grammar') the unit gives students deeper insight into the workings of English, while also introducing data from a range of other languages for the purposes of comparison. Students also reflect on how utterances are given meaning (semantics and pragmatics) and the importance of contextual factors in determining whether an utterance is grammatically correct or appropriate. </synopsis>

<title> Workplace learning internship </title>
<synopsis> The internship provides students with the opportunity to integrate theory with practice, and to gain first-hand experience in working in the area of specialty in which they want to pursue after graduation. The work placement is aimed at consolidating and extending what they have learnt from core units and other Degree units, through experiential learning. The unit develops their understanding of the application of academically obtained knowledge and skills in a workplace environment, and facilitates their acquisition of work-based networks for potential employment opportunities. Separate internship programs are drawn up for each student.As a capstone unit for those who intend to major in Gender Studies, this unit serves as the practicum for Gender and Sexuality Studies. The capstone experience enables these students to reflexively engage with the application of feminist and queer theories to the workplace. Work placements in non-governmental organisations in global contexts are strongly encouraged as these settings led themselves more adequately to such critical engagement of synergising the learning in the classroom and learning within the community. Feminist praxis that is aimed at realising social justice potentially finds expression through student- assessment of the relevance of a transformative education that potentially leads to exciting career prospects. </synopsis>

<title> Research for social work practice </title>
<synopsis> In all fields of contemporary social work, practitioners need the skills to effectively consume, produce and apply research knowledge, to ensure that actions are based on appropriate and critiqued evidence. Research is a powerful intervention tool through which change can be achieved with individuals, groups and communities. This unit is offered as part of the core requirements of the professional association, the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW). Social work research is seen to be informed by a clear value base and driven to deliver socially constructive outcomes. The unit will explore research processes, presenting a structured approach to the implementation of a research proposal. There will be particular emphasis on research in practice, program evaluation,  and program development, as well as the ethical underpinnings of all research. The overall aim of this unit is to encourage students to become critically reflective, research minded practitioners, who contribute in an ongoing way to the knowledge base of the profession. Students will engage in a range of learning activities, including interactive lectures, workshops, cross-disciplinary masterclasses and integrated online learning. Students will focus on learning the language and terminology of research, within a reflective practice framework. </synopsis>

In order to support the aircraft performance topics that form the core of the course, basic fluid mechanics is introduced so that students can understand and predict the main sources of lift and drag forces produced on aircraft.A brief introduction is also given to airbreathing aircraft powerplants so that students understand their basic characteristics and why different powerplant classes are appropriate to different flight speed regimes.  Aircraft longitudinal stability concepts are introduced, as are the basic phenomena of transonic and supersonic flight. </synopsis>

<title> The dark hero </title>
<synopsis> The unit is designed to introduce students to the development of the dark or satanic hero in a range of major English texts selected to illustrate the tremendous impact and popularity of this powerful figure. Writers since the Renaissance have created powerful and seductive heroes, anti-heroes and appealing villains who advocate and personify radical individualism, self-sufficiency and ambition, but who are often isolated, gloomy and dissatisfied by their revolt against God, morality and society. Special attention will be given to the gendered representation of the dark hero, particularly the persistent tendency to represent or view female characters who challenge moral codes in relation to prevailing social roles of virgin/whore, good/bad mother etc. The unit encourages students to examine the relationship between the satanic heroes, vamps and villains who appear in the unit texts and the many dark heroes of who have subsequently appeared in literature. </synopsis>

<title> Research for social work practice </title>
<synopsis> In all fields of contemporary social work, practitioners need the skills to effectively consume, produce and apply research knowledge, to ensure that actions are based on appropriate and critiqued evidence. Research is a powerful intervention tool through which change can be achieved with individuals, groups and communities. This unit is offered as part of the core requirements of the professional association, the Australian Association of Social Workers (AASW). Social work research is seen to be informed by a clear value base and driven to deliver socially constructive outcomes. The unit will explore research processes, presenting a structured approach to the implementation of a research proposal. There will be particular emphasis on research in practice, program evaluation,  and program development, as well as the ethical underpinnings of all research. The overall aim of this unit is to encourage students to become critically reflective, research minded practitioners, who contribute in an ongoing way to the knowledge base of the profession. Students will engage in a range of learning activities, including interactive lectures, workshops, cross-disciplinary masterclasses and integrated online learning. Students will focus on learning the language and terminology of research, within a reflective practice framework. </synopsis>

In order to support the aircraft performance topics that form the core of the course, basic fluid mechanics is introduced so that students can understand and predict the main sources of lift and drag forces produced on aircraft.A brief introduction is also given to airbreathing aircraft powerplants so that students understand their basic characteristics and why different powerplant classes are appropriate to different flight speed regimes.  Aircraft longitudinal stability concepts are introduced, as are the basic phenomena of transonic and supersonic flight. </synopsis>

<title> Drug cultures </title>
<synopsis> Using anthropological and ethnographic studies, this unit focuses on the social and cultural contexts of legal and illegal drug use.  In doing so it highlights the unique approaches and contribution of anthropology as a discipline to understanding behaviour.  We will examine various approaches in anthropology to drug use, including the symbolism of drugs, ritual behaviours, economic and political factors influencing the use, production and distribution of drugs and the way in which these processes are enmeshed in local cultures and social networks and the global political economy.  The unit will explore how patterns of drug use as well as dispositions towards use differ across cultural and social borders. Topics include: anthropological approaches to drugs as substances of value, power and desire; ethnomedicine and shamanism, bioprospecting and the trade in herbal medicines;  international traffic in drugs and its relationship to  regional politics and local tribal, peasant and commercial systems of production and exchange; drug  tourism; youth culture and drugs in the West; cultures of intravenous drug use;  the global political economy of pharmaceuticals,  clinical drug trials; antimicrobial resistance, the anthropology of contraceptives, erectile dysfunction drugs; anti-retrovirals in the age of AIDS; Australian and Pacific indigenous drug use; drug trafficking on the internet. </synopsis>

<title> History of philosophy: Emotions </title>
<synopsis> The unit will examine issues to do with emotions in the history of philosophy. In the pre-modern era, the emotions or 'passions', such as love, desire, fear, and sadness, were seen as mental states that arose involuntarily in the soul as a result of its close connection with the body. They were commonly regarded as corrupting influences on an agent's moral choices and actions. To overcome their influence, philosophers recommended various techniques for either suppressing the passions or turning them into virtues or excellences of character. Following the Augustinian tradition, many regarded love as the key to transforming the passions. This unit explores the moral and metaphysical dimensions of this subject, with reference to both male and female philosophers of the past. Some of the thinkers who may be discussed include St Augustine, Rene Descartes, Elisabeth of Bohemia, Mary Astell, and David Hume. Some of the themes in the unit may be followed into contemporary philosophical discussions. </synopsis>

<title> Extreme earth! Natural hazards and human vulnerability </title>
<synopsis> This unit takes as its starting point the catastrophes of our world today, such as droughts, earthquakes, epidemics, fires, floods, hurricanes, landslides, tsunamis and weather extremes, and seeks to provide a blended understanding between the mechanics and dynamics of these environmental phenomena with the social contexts in which these disasters occur. This subject analyses the wide range of environmental processes (hazards) that pose risks to human lives, livelihoods and settlements, and brings together physical and human geographical approaches to explore how risk in a chosen area is a function of both the hazards and the community's vulnerability. Local and international case studies form a central component of this unit. As well, questions pertaining to the role of international aid and risk management (including mitigation, protection and adaptation strategies) will be discussed. </synopsis>

<synopsis> The unit explores the ways God is imagined in a variety of religious and mystical traditions, focusing on Christian mysticism (early and medieval), classical Sufism (Islam), mystical currents within Judaism (rabbinic and Kabbalistic), as well as the transformations of mysticism in the post-enlightenment and secular world. It will consider how mystical literature and teaching relates to religious practice, its social/political function within any religion, and the extent to which it may challenge religious authority, while also drawing its discourse from a religious tradition. There will be opportunity to consider mysticism outside as well as within monotheist tradition. It thus raises questions about the nature of mysticism in its various forms, and its relationship to both rational and poetic thought. </synopsis>

The unit will take us beyond the individual explanations of health and ill health to an examination of some of the broad understandings about the courses of mental ill health and the strategies required to improve mental health. We examine the concept of need in relation to populations and take a practical approach to the process of assessing the mental health needs of populations and groups. Two major community intervention strategies to address mental health needs are examined. The role of consumer participation and collaboration and the notion of citizenship are explored in some detail. The unit concludes with a discussion of the skill base required for community mental health practice.Contents include:The policy context of community mental health practice;Practice Paradigms;Community as a place for mental health practice;The concept of need;Assessing mental health needs;Particular groups and the iInterpretation of need;Community based intervention models and strategies;Power, participation and collaboration;Consumers and citizenship. </synopsis>

This unit explores the rise of writing about music, and the many personalities who have long aspired to be the arbiters of taste, the keepers of standards and, in some instances, even the philosophers of their craft. Such writers have plied their trade in newspapers, journals, books, and, more recently, social media including Facebook and Twitter. By investigating key debates that have often sparked controversy and notoriety, the unit examines the role and function of music critics, broadcasters, journalists, philosophers, academics, magazine writers and bloggers, considering the agency that such individuals have exerted in the media past and present. In addition, students have the opportunity to develop key writing skills and produce work in print and digital forms. </synopsis>

<title> Cities and sustainability </title>
<synopsis> Cities are dynamic and complex environments that now comprise the majority of the world we live in but they face an array of major challenges.  These include: How do we make our cities more habitable and sustainable? How do we ensure social, economic, cultural, political and environmental equality?  How does the geography of cities and urban systems affect their sustainability? Have cities ever been sustainable and can they be in the future? How do we manage urban growth or decline? In this unit students will examine how contemporary cities operate by focussing on urban processes and functions, as well as relevant issues such as population, the economy, governance, resource use, housing and transport. </synopsis>

<title> Medieval Italy: Sites of encounter </title>
<synopsis> This unit explores medieval Italy from the eleventh to the fourteenth centuries as a site of encounter between a range of religious and cultural traditions: Islam, Judaism and both Latin and Greek Christianity, all sharing a common debt to classical antiquity. Taught in Prato, but involving travel to various locations in Italy. The unit provides an opportunity to understand the complex web of cultural interactions between Islam and Christianity in Sicily and southern Italy, as well as between Christians and Jews in Tuscany and other parts of northern Italy. It thus provides a wider context to understand medieval Italy and the writings of Dante in particular. The unit will involve close analysis of the built environments of medieval Italy and of the cultural artefacts surviving from the period to examine how both religious segregation and interaction shaped its culture. </synopsis>

<title> The assessment and management of problem behaviours </title>
<synopsis> The unit covers the aetiology and principles of management of commonly occurring antisocial 'problem behaviours' : violence, stalking, uttering threats, sexual offending, fire-setting, and abnormal complaining. Based on psychological and criminological theory of such behaviours a framework is presented, then applied to each specific behaviour. The role of mental disorder in the genesis of such behaviours is considered, in addition to the multiple psychological and social factors involved. Students will gain a theoretical understanding and develop a pragmatic model for working with a broad range of perpetrators in an ethical and evidence-based fashion. </synopsis>
